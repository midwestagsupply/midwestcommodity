/* The workflow files still parse, and this guard still catches the reason
 * they once did not.
 *
 * On 2026-08-20 both sites stopped building for seventeen hours. The tests
 * passed, the scripts ran, the token worked and the dispatch was accepted
 * with a 204 -- and every run went red with no steps in it, because GitHub
 * could not parse prices.yml. A job that cannot start cannot run the tests
 * that would have caught it, so the test suite was never the thing that
 * could have found this. THE FILE HAS TO BE CHECKED AS A FILE.
 *
 * This runs against the workflow files actually in the repository, not
 * against a fixture, for the same reason: a fixture cannot go stale into
 * a form that stops GitHub from starting the job.
